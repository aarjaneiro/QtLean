- Nuget
- QT 6

Building
--------
The project can be built by running:

```shell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

```


If you run into issues, note that one can execute `make {OPTION}` for any of the following options:

````
... all (the default if no target is provided)
... clean
... depend
... edit_cache
... rebuild_cache
... copy_config_files
... qtlean_autogen
... qtlean
... qtlean_autogen/mocs_compilation.o
... qtlean_autogen/mocs_compilation.i
... qtlean_autogen/mocs_compilation.s
... src/QJsonModel.o
... src/QJsonModel.i
... src/QJsonModel.s
... src/TreeEditor.o
... src/TreeEditor.i
... src/TreeEditor.s
... src/main.o
... src/main.i
... src/main.s
````

Usage
-----
From your build directory, enter the Lean subdirectory and execute

```shell
../QtLean
```

If QtLean is installed, it can be called from any Lean directory by executing:

```shell
QtLean
```

Although do note that Python may need to be manually configured if the Lean directory is not the one generated by CMake.
To use the configured Lean directory elsewhere, simply execute `cp -r your/path/to/qtlean/build/Lean dest/dir`

Installation
------------
After building, run the `install_user.sh` script in the build directory. Note that you will likely need to run this as a
super user.
